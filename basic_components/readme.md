## Components
* `alu`: a simple ALU.
* `dff`: a basic D flip-flop.
* `bcd_counter`: a modulo-10 counter with asynchronous reset and enable signal.
* `gate`s: a simple component to illustrate the difference between combinatorial logic and clocked process.
* `mux_2to1`: a 2-to-1 multiplexer (4 solutions).
* `mux_4to1`: a 4-to-1 multiplexer (4 solutions).
* `myfsm`: a FSM with 3 states decomposed in 3 processes.
* `seg_decoder`: a 7-segment decoder.
