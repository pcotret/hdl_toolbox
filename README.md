# hdl_toolbox

Some basic components that may be useful in the future, a few scripts/notes about tools...

## Three folders:
* simulations => Screenshots of timing diagrams if available.
* src => VHDL sources.
* testbenches => Related testbenches.

## Components:
* alu: a simple ALU.
* bcd_counter: a modulo-10 counter with asynchronous reset and enable signal.
* gates: a simple component to illustrate the difference between combinatorial logic and clocked process.
* mux_2to1: a 2-to-1 multiplexer (4 solutions).
* mux_4to1: a 4-to-1 multiplexer (4 solutions).
* myfsm: a FSM with 3 states decomposed in 3 processes.
* seg_decoder: a 7-segment decoder.
